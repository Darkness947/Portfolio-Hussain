                    <p className="card-text">
                        I am a passionate Software Engineering student at PMU. My journey into technology started with curiosity,
                        but quickly evolved into a mission: to build, create, and leave a legacy through code.
                        <br /><br />
                        I have developed multiple projects including <strong>Darkness Takeover</strong> â€” a solo-developed psychological horror game,
                        and the <strong>PMU Schedule Maker</strong>, a full client-side tool to help students manage their time.
                        <br /><br />
                        I am also actively learning Data Science and working on enhancing my skills in Full Stack Development.
                        My dream is to build products that blend story, technology, and impact. One line of code at a time.
                        <br /><br />
                        I believe in learning by doing, dreaming big, and staying consistent. Welcome to my world!

                    <h4 className="card-title">Beyond Code: My Mindset</h4>
                    <p className="card-text">
                        I believe in crafting with purpose. Whether it is designing a game world or building a data dashboard,
                        I approach every project with creativity, discipline, and heart.
                        <br /><br />
                        I am driven by values â€” <strong>Faith, Family, Focus</strong>. These guide my personal growth and every line of code I write.
                        <br /><br />
                        In my free time, you will find me gaming, watching movies, or writing project ideas.
                        <br /><br />
                        This portfolio is not just a showcase â€” it is a living record of my growth. And this is only the beginning.
